## Data Processing and De-identification

Your audiovisual data will be processed using the SYNAPSIS platform (https://synapsis.nl), which applies privacy-preserving techniques:

### Face De-identification
- [ ] **Face blurring**: Faces will be blurred to prevent identification
- [ ] **Face masking**: Faces will be replaced with synthetic faces while preserving expressions
- [ ] **Pixelation**: Facial regions will be pixelated
- [ ] **Other**: [specify method]

### Voice Anonymization
- [ ] **Pitch shifting**: Voice pitch will be modified
- [ ] **Formant modification**: Voice characteristics will be altered
- [ ] **No voice modification**: Audio will remain unaltered
- [ ] **Audio removal**: Audio track will be removed entirely

### Body Data Extraction
- [ ] **Pose extraction**: Body movement data (skeleton points) may be extracted
- [ ] **Gesture analysis**: Hand and body gestures may be analyzed
- [ ] **No body data extraction**

## Data Storage and Security

- **Processing Location**: Data will be processed on SURF infrastructure within the Netherlands
- **Encryption**: All data is encrypted during transfer and storage
- **Retention Period**:
  - Original (unmasked) data: Deleted after [X days/months] or upon your request
  - De-identified data: Retained for [X years] for research purposes
- **Access Control**: Only authorized researchers will have access to the data
